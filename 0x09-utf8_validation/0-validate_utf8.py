"""
This software defines rules to check if an integer combination is a valid
UTF-8 Encoding

A valid UTF-8 character can be 1 - 4 bytes long.
For a 1-byte character, the first bit is a 0, followed by its unicode.
For an n-bytes character, the first n-bits are all ones, the n+1 bit is 0,
followed by n-1 bytes with most significant 2 bits being 10.
